# Light-Controll
A Webserver to controll the light in a room

## Idea
The light in my room is capable of changing the brightness / color via a remote controll. 
Since i only have normal light switches i am not capable of controlling these states.
To get rid of this problem a webpage for mobile and computers has been written.
Now i can place an old tablet over my normal light switches to have a better controll of the light.
Also i am now capable of controlling the light over my mobile phone.

### Light On
